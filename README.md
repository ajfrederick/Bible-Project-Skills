# The Bible Project Skills Assessment

Here is a set of callouts to get a Salesforce access token and the ability create and update addresses. I created 3 scenarios or possibilites on how to tackle this since initially the requirements weren't super clear to me though they were eventually made clear by Matt.  
The scenarios (i.e. differences in data delivered in request, expectations of api functionality, etc.) are changed by a header 'Scenario' value which references a name of a service layer APEX class. I would never do this in 'real life' but I had fun cooking something up that was dynamic enough to handle several scenarios.
